If crafting costs for Titanium drill x655 > 350,000,000 coins it is more worth while to buy it off of the auction house. However if pristine 5 is present
on the drill then buying it for up to 365,000,000 would be a good deal. If the drill is recombobulated with a perfect Topaz, Amber and Jade then if all of the afformentioned
upgrades are present then it would be worth it to buy it up to the price of 405,000,000 coins.
